# week-7-lab
This is part of week 7 lab for big ideas.
This program asks for the name and age of the user then prints out a few sentences about those things. It will tell you if you have a long name and if you don't it will just compliment you. If you are under 18 it will tell you that you can not vote but at least you can buy ice cream. If you are over 18 it will inform you that you are an adult.
As long as you follow our guidelines about being appropriate and not bothering others you can freely add to this.
Group members: Kirsten, Tyree, Mercedes
